Project:  Project1-About Me
Name: Jeremiah Nicholls
Submitted: Aug 20, 2021
 
I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection :  I found myself quite suprised that the semester was getting off to such a rapid start.
I was forced to miss the first two classes due to UVU covid exposure protocol, and found myself quite behind already. 
It's quite unfortunate but I will be making up the rest of it as fast as I possibly can.

	<h2> To the best year yet </h2>
	
	<pre>
I love my wife, Moo
That's not deragatory
It's an inside joke
	</pre> 
	<p> My inspiration for this poem is today is the one year anniversary of the day I eloped with my wife.</p>
	
	<h2> My personal interests </h2>
		<p> There are several things I am quite passonate about. The first is cars. The second is computer hardware.
		the third is the outdoors.</p>
		<p> I am incredibly passonate about cars. I have always been that way for as long as I can remember.
		Some of my earliest memories invole looking out the windows at passing cars with my brother and *Calling* them.</p>
		<p> I am fascinated about electronic hardware. From everything to photography drones, cameras, desktops
		phones, if it's got a micro-processor I have an oppinion on it. I still think the greatest smartphone ever created
		was the HTC One M8. Although it is pathetic compaired to todays smartphone processing power, the hardware features were 2nd to none</p>
		<p> I find great pleasure being in the outdoors. I spent a large part of my teen years in the Boy Scouts program. This taught
		 me how to be a better outdoorsman. </p>
